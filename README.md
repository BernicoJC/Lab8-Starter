## Short paragraph about graceful degradation and service workers
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because both involve adding in to an already done product in order to accomodate users who are less able to keep up with said fully done product. Graceful degradation allows us to have our application running with some of the features missing / reduced for those unable to use it, while service workers did something that's similar, but instead focused more on users with limited or no network connection but still our application can run.
